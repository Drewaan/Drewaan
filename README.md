## 🚀 Core Systems Portfolio (42)
A series of foundational projects demonstrating my ability to tackle increasing complexity in systems programming:

| Project | Technical Domain | Key Engineering Highlight |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------|
| **get_next_line** | File Handling | Efficient line-reading function handling static buffers, file descriptors, and edge cases across multiple calls. |
| **ft_printf** | Variadic Functions | Complete reimplementation of `printf()` supporting format parsing, variadic arguments, and flag management. |
| **Push_Swap** | Algorithms & Optimization | Design of an optimized stack-based sorting algorithm under strict operational constraints. |
| **Pipex** | Inter-Process Communication | Low-level reproduction of UNIX pipelines using `pipe()`, `fork()`, `dup2()`, and process synchronization. |
| **FdF** | Computer Graphics | 3D wireframe rendering engine featuring isometric projections, transformations, and interactive controls. |
| **Minishell** | UNIX Systems Programming | Development of a functional shell with command parsing, environment handling, redirections, pipelines, and signal management. |
| **Philosophers** | Concurrency & Synchronization | Multi-threaded simulation solving the Dining Philosophers problem while preventing deadlock and starvation via mutexes. |
| **C++ Modules (00–04)** | Object-Oriented Programming | Progressive mastery of C++ fundamentals, memory management, operator overloading, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract interfaces. |
| **Cub3D** | Graphics / Ray-Casting Engine | Pseudo-3D game engine based on ray-casting with DDA, real-time player movement, texture mapping, and event-driven rendering using MLX42. |
