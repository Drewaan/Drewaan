## 🚀 Core Systems Portfolio (42)
A series of foundational projects demonstrating my ability to tackle increasing complexity in systems programming:

| Project | Technical Domain | Key Engineering Highlight |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------|
| **Philosophers** | Concurrency & Threads | Multi-threaded simulation solving the Dining Philosophers problem while preventing deadlock and starvation using mutexes. |
| **Minishell** | UNIX Systems / Shell | Construction of a command interpreter with parsing, child process management, I/O redirection, and pipelines. |
| **Pipex** | Inter-Process Communication | Recreation of the shell piping mechanism using `pipe()`, `fork()`, and `dup2()`. |
| **Push_Swap** | Sorting Algorithms | Highly optimized sorting algorithm for stacks with a limited set of operations. |
| **FdF** | 3D Graphics & Projection | 3D wireframe model generation with isometric/parallel projections, rotation, and zoom. |
| **ft_printf** | Variadic Functions | Robust reimplementation of `printf()` managing variable arguments and format flags. |
| **get_next_line** | File Handling | Efficient line-reading function solving static buffer persistence challenges. |
